# TensorFlow-AutoEncoders
This Repositary explores application of autoencoders in unsupervised learning. 
There two notebooks in the repository:
  - The first one shows how to  conduct a binary classification task with autoencoders.
  - The Second one shows how to perform a multiclass classication. 

Libraries used for autoencoders:
  - Tensorflow
  - Keras

Methods used for classification:
  - K-Means
